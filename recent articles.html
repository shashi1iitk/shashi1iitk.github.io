<h3>NSO H&F and its relavance</h3>
<p>Alarm at 5, rushing to find the cycle keys and reaching the stadium panting but oops... you will not be given any attendance because you are late, going to room crying upon the efforts to make a night-out solely for the attendance and finally failing for the 7th time. Students enrolled in NSO H&F must be aware of these incidents. Is it really worth? If yes, then why are the students criticizing? If not, shouldn not they come up for their betterment, but that s the fact that your initiative will not add to your grades so, leave it. This is more or less the dilemma students are facing in NSO H&F.<a href="http://awaaziitkgp.org/nso.php">Read more</a></p><hr />
<h3>There's more than meets the eye</h3>
<p>The General Championships have always been about ons attachment to ones own hall, generally termed as Hall Tempo. These events must have been introduced with an aim to foster the all-round development of the students. But the lofty ideals of this aim seem to be waning as the GC has become sort of a war where one needs the victory at any cost, be it after the sacrifice of moral values and the sense of fair-play. An example can be cited of the event of Product Design this year which saw a weird set of proceedings.<a href="http://awaaziitkgp.org/product_design.php">Read more</a></p><hr />

<h3>Campus Politics at IITs</h3>
<p>Few days back, I came across an op-ed written by Chetan Bhagat, where he makes a point for campus politics in the IITs as opposed to the campus politics in colleges like JNU and DU. I also happened to read this article by a certain Aditya Mani Jha, alumnus of IIT Kharagpur who works as a full-time journalist now. He talks about how having a 'toothless' students' body like the one in the IITs, may sometimes result in mayhem, similar (in effect, not in cause) to what JNU and DU have been observing lately.<a href="">Read more</a></p><hr />
<h3>Artificial Intelligence:Motivation,Implication&Application</h3>
<p>With the progress of mankind, many things have improved with the times. We have discovered tools & technology that can improve the quality of life. Health index, happiness quotient, in fact, our overall lifestyle has undergone a change for the better as compared to the last few decades with the advent of technology- primarily in the internet and portable devices. Life expectancy has improved owing to better medical facilities compared to the last few decades but has inadvertently given rise to the population explosion. One thing has, however remained constant with the planet earth, that is a man still does need food. This means that the same amount of land in earth has to feed more and more people.<a href="http://awaaziitkgp.org/ai.php">Read more</a></p>
